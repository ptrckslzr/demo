This sample test project is design for the website with url https://jupiter.cloud.planittesting.com/
It has 3 java test automation test scripts that is readily available for integration with a pipeline.
The Jenkins pipeline is not yet integrated as of the moment as the laptop that I ues doesn't have enough privilege to run the jenkins services.
Jenkins pipeline integration references are available online and seems to be fairly easy to integrate.
